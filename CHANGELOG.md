# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Local Snapshots" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.10] - 2025-02-12

### üöÄ Major Performance & Configurability Improvements

- **Configurable Batch Processing:** Added new settings `localSnapshots.batchSize`, `localSnapshots.batchDelay`, and `localSnapshots.maxParallelBatches` to allow users to adjust snapshot processing behavior.
- **Faster Processing:** Improved parallel file processing and smarter batching by replacing hardcoded constants with configurable methods, resulting in significantly faster snapshot creation for large workspaces.
- **Enhanced Type Safety & Code Quality:** Resolved multiple linter errors by removing duplicate interface declarations and updating method signatures to ensure proper type compatibility (e.g., for progress reporting).
- **Smarter File Handling:** Implemented caching for file metadata and optimized file filtering based on ignore patterns (including .gitignore integration) and common binary file types.

üí° **Tips:**
- Adjust the new batch processing settings in the extension configuration to optimize performance for your setup.
- Leverage .gitignore integration and custom ignore patterns for even better snapshot efficiency.

## [0.0.9] - 2025-02-12

### üéâ New Feature: Ignore Patterns Management

We're excited to introduce a powerful new feature that gives you more control over which files are included in your snapshots!

#### üîÑ Automatic .gitignore Integration
- Your existing .gitignore patterns are now automatically respected
- Patterns from .gitignore files are synced in real-time
- Visual indicators show which patterns come from .gitignore
- Changes to .gitignore files are detected and updated automatically

#### ‚ú® Custom Ignore Patterns
- Add your own patterns to exclude files from snapshots
- Easy-to-use visual interface for managing patterns
- Search functionality to find specific patterns
- Visual workspace file browser to select files/folders to ignore
- Right-click context menu integration in VS Code's explorer

#### üõ†Ô∏è New Settings
- `localSnapshots.respectGitignore`: Toggle .gitignore integration (on by default)
- `localSnapshots.customIgnorePatterns`: Define your own exclude patterns

#### üí° How to Use
1. Click the "Manage Ignore Patterns" button in the Local Snapshots sidebar
2. View your current patterns, including those from .gitignore
3. Add new patterns either by:
   - Typing them directly in the input field
   - Right-clicking files/folders in VS Code's explorer
   - Using the workspace browser in the ignore patterns view
4. Search through patterns and workspace files using the search boxes
5. Remove custom patterns with the delete button (note: .gitignore patterns can only be modified in the .gitignore file)

#### üöÄ Performance Improvements
- Enhanced snapshot performance through optimized file filtering
- Efficient pattern matching using the 'ignore' package
- Smart caching of .gitignore patterns for better performance
